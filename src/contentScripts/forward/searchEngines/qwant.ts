// OK. This should not be as hard as it is.
// The better way would be to use webNavigation-API,
// but this would disable the extension on update, or we have to ask every time...

// Also the "window" property seems to be shared but only parts of it.
// For example we can not register a proxy for history.pushState().

// There are three options:
// 1. A mutation observer that listens for every change in DOM and then checks the URL
// 2. Injecting a script-Tag into the page that listens for changes in the URL
// 3. setInterval and look for changes in the URL

// 2. seems to be hard as we want to do not any stuff but use functions from the extension
// 3. is not really nice, but it works
// This means we should probably go with 1?
